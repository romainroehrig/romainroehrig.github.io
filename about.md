I am **Ingénieur des Ponts, des Eaux et des Forêts** and research scientist in the climate research group of Météo-France ([GMGEC](https://www.umr-cnrm.fr/spip.php?rubrique89)), in the field of atmospheric physics and global climate modeling. I am **leading a small team in charge of the development of the global atmospheric model ARPEGE-Climat**, which is the atmospheric component of the CNRM Earth System model. I am thus working on parameterization development and evaluation, model calibration and model evaluation. I am also largely interested by better understanding **scale interactions in the tropics**, i.e. the two-way interactions between small-scale processes (e.g., convection and clouds) and the large-scale circulation and its variability. In particular, **I envision the development of parameterizations and their successful implementation in a climate model as a way to increase and synthesize our understanding of atmospheric processes and their role in the climate system**. The climate model, which I am contributing to, thus serves as an important research tool for my scientific questions. The latest include:
- How does the organization of convection impact the properties of the tropical climate and its variability? And vice-versa, how can the large-scale environment constrain the properties of convection, including its extremes?
- To what extent are heterogeneities in the land surface and the near-surface atmosphere critical for the climate water and energy cycle?

To tackle my research objectives, I am using a wide range of data, tools and approaches: 
- **high-resolution simulations**, from large-eddy to global kilometer-scale simulations, which resolve at least part of, if not all, the processes I am interested in. They serve both as a reference for process-level evaluation of climate model and as exploratory data to question and enhance the conceptual models at the heart of parameterizations.
- **most recent observations**, from field campaigns and spaceborne sensors. These are invaluable data to evaluate all the hierarchy of modelling tools (high-resolution simulations, climate model simulations under various configurations and with various couplings).
- **up-to-date statistical or machine-learning-based tools**, especially for accelerating the calibration of climate models.

I am currently co-leading with [Martin Vancoppenolle](https://pagesperso.locean-ipsl.upmc.fr/mvlod/) and [Nicolas Jourdain](https://nicojourdain.github.io/) the national project **[IMPRESSION-ESM](https://pepr-traccs.fr/projet/pc7-impression-esm/)**, which is part of the PEPR [TRACCS](https://pepr-traccs.fr/), and which aims at improving the representation of physical processes in the two French Earth system models. My other current responsibilities include
- member of the **Working Group on Numerical Experimentation** ([WGNE](https://www.wcrp-esmo.org/working-groups/wgne)) since 2021.
- member of the scientific committee of the **community software [LMDZ](https://lmdz.lmd.jussieu.fr/)** since 2020 (president from 2020 to 2024);
